### Total Hours: 2

## Overview:


Desired Specs-

- Wooden plus metal build
- 128x32 oled screen for display or bigger 
- multi-color (maybe)
- raspi 4 or 5 controller
- foldable necessary
- basic control like normal printers(specifically hp m 1005) so that it can print using sd cards or pendrives too.
- possibly a control system from mobile or pc.
 

## Day 1 (3rd Feb, 2025)

Did research on printers and how they work

- I am thinking of using acrylic sheets for base and looks
- Also wood for base(which will make it heavy but it will give a good build too so if hopefully never it gets droped or kicked by mistake it won't get damaged.) and for there areas metal.
- I can also go for full metal build.
- A simple screen for display purpose can be changed into proper control system will be decided according to budget after checking all the parts. I want to keep it as low as possible.
- Did a little bit of researching about 3D printer parts

I want this thing to be able to fit in a small box so I can print whenever I want and keep it aside somewhere.
Main idea is to be able to make a printer more like blot and disassemble or fold the top side.
