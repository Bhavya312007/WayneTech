### Total Hours: 6


- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st
      
---

## Overview:


Desired Specs-

- Wooden plus metal build
- 128x32 oled screen for display or bigger 
- multi-color (maybe)
- raspi 4 or 5 controller
- foldable necessary
- basic control like normal printers(specifically hp m 1005) so that it can print using sd cards or pendrives too.
- possibly a control system from mobile or pc.
 

## Day 1 (13 March, 2025)

Did research on printers and how they work

- I am thinking of using acrylic sheets for base and looks
- Also wood for base(which will make it heavy but it will give a good build too so if hopefully never it gets droped or kicked by mistake it won't get damaged.) and for there areas metal.
- I can also go for full metal build.
- A simple screen for display purpose can be changed into proper control system will be decided according to budget after checking all the parts. I want to keep it as low as possible.
- Did a little bit of researching about 3D printer parts

I want this thing to be able to fit in a small box so I can print whenever I want and keep it aside somewhere.
Main idea is to be able to make a printer more like blot and disassemble or fold the top side.

### Time Elapsed: 2 Hrs


## Day 2 (14 March, 2025)

Did a little more research on printers. Its so confusing and i don't ahve a 3d printer right now.

### Time Elapsed: 1 Hrs

## Day 3 (15 March, 2025)

Today i watched mostly tutorials and made a sketch of what kind of printer i want finally.
It will be a xy printer and bed will go down from up. I want it to be able to fast print. 

### Time Elapsed: 2 Hrs

## Day 3 (16 March, 2025)

 I have decided to make voron printer maybe trident or 0.2 but under 200-300 dollors as it starts from $600. I won't make a 3d model but will use vorons that will be easy to implement.
